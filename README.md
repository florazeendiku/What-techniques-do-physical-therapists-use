<p>Your healthcare practitioner may recommend you to physical therapy if you have a musculoskeletal injury or movement dysfunction. <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://p5perform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Physical therapy clinic</a>&nbsp;can aid you with discomfort and increase mobility. Your symptoms might be minor, or they could seriously impede your functional mobility.</p>
<p>Patients who are referred to physical therapy have a variety of treatment alternatives. Your <strong>physical therapist&rsquo;s clinic</strong> will frequently employ biological agents and modalities to supplement your treatment and aid in achieving your rehab goals. They can be used to reduce inflammation and discomfort. Exercises to enhance endurance, strength, or range of motion may be given. Your <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://p5perform.com/services/physical-rehab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plano sports therapy</a>&nbsp;should explain why each therapy modality is used and what to expect from each treatment to you. Below are some of them.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Exercise</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Exercise applies regulated physical stress to the body to develop strength, range of motion, or flexibility. There are two types of training: passive and active. A passive workout is when you just rest while someone else applies the tension, such as a <strong>physical therapist</strong>. A hamstring stretch, for example, involves lifting your leg to lengthen the hamstring muscle on the back of your thigh.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ultrasound</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Ultrasound is a deep heating therapy used to treat sprains, strains, and tendonitis in the musculoskeletal system. 1 Your physical therapist will use an ultrasound machine to perform the procedure. A good head is a wand that is softly pushed against your skin and manipulated in short circular sweeps around the injury location. The ultrasonic waves are absorbed into the skin and muscles using a small gel.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Traction</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Traction is used to reduce pain and enhance spine mobility in treating low back pain4 and neck pain.</p>
<p>In either a seated or <strong>sleeping posture</strong>, cervical traction is used. A harness is worn around the neck when sitting, and a pulley system with a modest weight is utilized.</p>
<p>Traction, in theory, helps to separate the joints and disc spaces in the low back or neck, reducing pressure on the spinal nerves.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Massage</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Massage involves kneading the wounded tissues of your body with your hands to relieve pain, enhance circulation, and reduce muscular tension. Effleurage, petrissage, and <strong>trigger point massage </strong>are just a few massage methods available.</p>
<p>Hot packs are stored in a device called a hydrocollator at a <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://p5perform.com/services/physical-rehab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sports rehabilitation center</a>. This is a huge hot water tank. The hot bags are cotton and packed with sand, clay, and silica. After absorbing the hot water, the hot pack is wrapped in terry cloth coverings and towels and applied to your body. For 15 to 20 minutes, the heat pack is generally applied to the wounded body region.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ice</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>you can <strong>use cold packs or ice</strong> on your body to reduce pain and inflammation. Ice is commonly used to reduce localized edema surrounding tissues during acute or early stages of an injury.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Iontophoresis</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Iontophoresis is an electrical stimulation used to deliver medicine to inflamed or wounded tissues via the skin. Inflammation is commonly treated with a steroid such as a dexamethasone. This steroid can aid in the reduction of pain and swelling caused by inflamed tissues.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Light or laser therapy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The procedure is painless and typically takes one to three minutes to complete. Your physical therapist will initiate fair treatment by holding the light-emitting wand directly over your affected body area and pressing a button.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Kinesiology Taping</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Physical therapists frequently employ kinesiology taping, or K-tape, to supplement your <strong>rehab regimen</strong>. The tape is constructed of a stretchy cloth that pulls and expands as you move. It can help for</p>
<ul>
    <li>Muscle inhibition</li>
    <li>Muscle facilitation</li>
    <li>Bruising and swelling reduction</li>
    <li>Pain alleviation</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Whirlpool</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Whirlpools are a kind of hydrotherapy that may promote circulation, keep wounds clean, or reduce inflammation and are offered by <strong>various physical therapists in Plano</strong>. Whirlpools come in two temperatures: hot and cold. A hot whirlpool is usually heated to between 98- and 110-degrees Fahrenheit. A chilly whirlpool bath temperature is generally between 50- and 60-degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Maintaining Long-Term Back Pain Relief</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Back pain sufferers are recommended to engage in other relevant therapies (including an exercise regimen) during and after manual therapy treatment by a <strong>Physical therapist</strong> to maintain the healing process and prevent recurrence of pain. The objective is to keep the proper type and amount of exercise to minimize duplication of pain and the need for frequent therapy appointments.</p>
